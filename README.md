Computer vision project: build a football analysis system with YOLO v11

Dataset for fine tuning: https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-jvuqo/football-players-detection-3zvbc/dataset/1

Goalkeeper is detected more accurately with fine tuned model.

Tried data augmentation(crop and zoom in), still not good.
